### 0.4.0 ###
- solid2fastq: Reversed the meaning of "read1" and "read2" file names for 
mate-pairs.  "read1" is the first read in a pair and "read2" is the second 
read, 5' to 3'.

- solid2fastq: Added support for new native SOLiD file read type "F5-RNA" and 
variations on "QV" placement in quality files.

- solid2fastq: Added -x parameter to turn of read ID suffix of "/1" and "/2".

- trimfastq:  Removed -c parameter.  This parameter toggled dinucleotide error 
probability calculation.  Now trimfastq automatically detects if a read set is 
colorspace or nucleotide and chooses the appropriate error probability 
calculation method.

- fastq_nodup: Fixed bug where index lengths of 32 would cause a segfault.

- fastq_nodup: Fixed bug where too many singlets were removed.

- Added new programs ref_select, tetracalc, graph_ops, and many other utility
scripts.
